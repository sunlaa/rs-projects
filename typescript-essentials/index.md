# My TypeScript Journey: Earned Badges üèÜ

## Badges Overview

Here is a collection of badges I earned from completing Microsoft Learn's TypeScript modules:

1. **Getting Started with TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/7ewf644z)
###### Reflection:
This module introduced me to TypeScript, I made sure that the use of this language can make code maintenance easier and help me avoid potential errors. 
- I learned that TypeScript is an extended version of JavaScript.
- I found out that a `.ts` file is compiled into a `.js` file for execution.
- I have taught myself how to install TypeScript.
- I figured out how to compile a `.ts` file into `.js`
- I learned the basic settings in the configuration file - `tsconfig.json`
2. **Declare Variable Types in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/8rg9l7lw)
###### Reflection:
This module introduced me to what types exist in TypeScript. I also learned how to declare variables with types. This module helped me to better understand why typing is useful. By declaring variables with types, we limit the passing of values of types we don't want. And if we don't know what types are coming to us - we can use `any` and `unknow` types - the only difference is that you are unable to interact with a variable of type `unknown`. In the future, using TypeScript I will use different data types for more readable code and the possibility to maintain it in an uncomplicated way.
- I learned what types exist in TypeScript and that they are all subtypes of the type `any`.
- I learned how to declare variables with primitive data types like `string`, `number`, `boolean`.
- I got acquainted with the concept of **enumerations**.
- I realized the difference between `any` and `unknow` types.
- I learned about **union** (one of several types) and **intersection** (combines two or more types) types.
- I discovered that there is a narrower type for defining a collective type - **literal** type.
- I was introduced to the **tuples** type, which defines a type structure within an array.
3. **Implement Interfaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/yvha644r)
4. **Develop Typed Functions in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/fzuyn3gx)
5. **Declare and Instantiate Classes in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/uf5f2bq3)
6. **Generics in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/hygry9j8)
7. **Work with External Libraries in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/j6e85ebt)
8. **Organize Code with Namespaces in TypeScript**: [Badge](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/users/sunlaa-4038/achievements/uf5z2lg3)
